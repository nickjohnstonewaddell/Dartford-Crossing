        <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-vehicle-tax-exemption-disability">get free UK vehicle tax because of a disability</a> (your vehicle will be checked automatically when you cross - you do not need to do anything)</li>

      </h2>

      <p>If you pay council tax to Dartford borough council or Thurrock council and are part of the local resident discount scheme, the annual cost is either:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>£20.00 for as many crossings as you want</li>
        <li>£10.00 for 50 crossings, plus 20p for each additional crossing</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
        Cars, motorhomes and minibuses
      </h2>

      <p>This includes cars with trailers. It only includes minibuses that have 9 or fewer seats (including the driver’s seat).</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>£2.50 as a one-off payment</li>

        <li>£3.00 as a one-off payment</li>
        <li>£2.63 if you have a pre-pay account</li>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
        Fines
      </h2>

      <p>You will get a fine if you do not pay the charge. You must pay it within 28 days. The fine is:</p>

        <li>£105 if not paid within 28 days</li>
      </ul>
