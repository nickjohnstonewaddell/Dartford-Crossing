      <h2 id="no-charge" class="govuk-heading-l">
        No charge
      </h2>

      <p>There is no charge if you:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>drive a motorcycle, moped or quad bike</li>
        <li>use the crossing at night, between 10pm and 6am</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-vehicle-tax-exemption-disability">get free UK vehicle tax because of a disability</a> (your vehicle will be checked automatically when you cross - you do not need to do anything)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="lrds" class="govuk-heading-l">
        Local resident discount scheme
      </h2>

      <p>If you pay council tax to Dartford Borough Council or Thurrock Council and are part of the local resident discount scheme, the annual cost is either:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>£20.00 for as many crossings as you want</li>
        <li>£10.00 for up to 50 crossings (you can then pay another £10 for as many further crossings as you want)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Find your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council">local council</a>.</p>

      <h2 id="cars" class="govuk-heading-l">
        Cars, motorhomes and minibuses
      </h2>

      <p>This includes cars with trailers. It only includes minibuses that have 9 or fewer seats (including the driver’s seat).</p>

      <p>The cost is:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>£2.50 as a one-off payment</li>
        <li>£2.00 if you have a pre-pay account</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="hgvs" class="govuk-heading-l">
        Buses, coaches, vans and other goods vehicles
      </h2>

      <p>If the vehicle has 2 axles, the cost is:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>£3.00 as a one-off payment</li>
        <li>£2.63 if you have a pre-pay account</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If the vehicle has more than 2 axles, the cost is:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>£6.00 as a one-off payment</li>
        <li>£5.19 if you have a pre-pay account</li>
      </ul>

        summaryText: "How to determine the number of axles",
        text: "Lift axles (also called retractable axles or droppable axles) can be raised so that the tyres are not touching the road. Count these whether they’re up or down. Only count trailer axles for articulated vehicles."
      }) }}

      <h2 id="fines" class="govuk-heading-l">
        Fines
      </h2>

      <p>You will get a fine if you do not pay the charge. You must pay it within 28 days. The fine is:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>£35 if paid within 14 days</li>
        <li>£70 if paid within 28 days</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You'll need to pay the crossing charge as well as the fine.</p>

      <p>You can <a href="#">pay or challenge the fine online</a> or call the <a href="start#contactdartcharge">Dart Charge contact centre</a>.</p>
